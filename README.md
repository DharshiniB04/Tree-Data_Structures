# Tree-Data_Structures

Trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes connected by edges.

In this repository, we provide implementations of two types of trees:

Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree in which each node has at most two children, and the left child contains a value less than the parent node, while the right child contains a value greater than the parent node.

Binary Tree (BT): A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
